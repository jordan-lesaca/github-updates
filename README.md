Currently Taking a Refresher for React and learning additional features that I didn't cover in Flatiron. 
Goal is to use the information I learn from this course and implement it with everything I learned from Flatiron in order to build a new dynamic app. 
During this time, I've also learned how to use PlayWright for creating tests to ensure my code is working as intended.
