# github-updates

Hello, I'm Jordan. Welcome to my GitHub. In this about me, I intend to update this so that if people want to know what I'm up to, they can always check the recent updates here. I will be posting updates stating what I'm currently working on and possibly future goals.

-- Updates ~ 09/13/2022 -- 
Currently Taking a Refresher for React and learning additional features that I didn't cover in Flatiron. 
Goal is to use the information I learn from this course and implement it with everything I learned from Flatiron in order to build a new dynamic app. 
During this time, I've also learned how to use PlayWright for creating tests to ensure my code is working as intended.
